## Instructions for running:
The directory containing the bots must look like this (assuming you don't modify the scripts).
```
/path/to/dir
|-bots
|-tokens
```
Use the `startbot` script to run the bots *while you are in the directory* i.e. `./startbot botname`.
The script will run `node` with the specified script in the background.

The bots folder contains the bot scripts.

The tokens folder contains files named `botname.token` containing the secret token of the app with
**NO TRAILING NEWLINE**. These tokens are not included in this repository (because then you could
impersonate our bots).
